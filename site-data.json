    "research_summary": "My research focuses on data-driven modeling and model reduction for dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in EDMD from a Koopman-operator perspective, with the goal of constructing lower-dimensional representations that capture the essential behavior of complex systems. My current work explores both theoretical and computational aspects of these approaches, with an emphasis on methods that are reliable, interpretable, and broadly applicable."
